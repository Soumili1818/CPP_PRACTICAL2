Task1: How the preprocessor will react when you try to use, #include<iostream.h> instead of #include<iostream>?

Task2: How the preprocessor will react when you use cout but don't include #include<iostream> in your code?

Task3: Take a char variable and use cin to take its value from the user, cout it and it will only return one character and loss rest of the data you have entered!

Task4: How to resolve above issue? [Hint: by using, getline(cin, line);]

  add(int,int), add(float, float), both of these methods are in two different namespaces First and Second respectively.

Task1: Access these methods using scope resolution operator [::](SRO) from main method?

Task2: Access these methods using "using" keyword for main method?

Task3:  Try to access these methods without using, (SRO) and "using" keyword and check how the compiler will react to it?
